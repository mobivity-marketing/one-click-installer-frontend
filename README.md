# [SmartReceipt](http://www.receipt.com) One-Click Installer Frontend

## About

This repository has the front end code to work on the One-Click Installer for SmartReceipt

## To Work in This Project:

* Fork this repository.
* Clone the forked repository to your local machine by typing `git clone git@github.com:mobivity-marketing/one-click-installer-frontend.git` into your terminal.
* If you don't already have [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com) installed globally, run `npm install -g grunt-cli` in the terminal.
* In the terminal, navigate (`cd`) into the project directory, and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run `grunt watch` to preview while working (open `index.html` in your browser), and `grunt` to compile all code when you're finished.
* Make any SCSS/JS changes within the `src` directory, and edit pages within the main directory. All files inside of the `dist` directory will be deleted and replaced with each run of `grunt`, making it important to only work within the `src` directory.

## Built With:

* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (Thanks to [Matt Bailey](http://mattbailey.io/a-beginners-guide-to-grunt-redux/) for the Grunt setup template).
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Bootstrap v3.3.5](http://getbootstrap.com/)
